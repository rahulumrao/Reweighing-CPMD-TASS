# Temperatture Accelarated Sliced Sampling (TASS) method combines
# temperature accelerated molecular dynamics with umbrella sampling and
# metadynamics to sample the collective variable space in an efficient manner.

# This Modular Fortran program unbias the Probability of TASS output generated in CPMD run
# which can be used to compute multidimensional (1D/2D/3D) free energy via WHAM reweighing
# It can also directly generate 1D free enrgy using Mean Force method (PMF)
# Basis Spline interpolation can be performed to find intermediate points in free energy

How to Run -->
"-------------"
Two bash script is given along with the program (run_pmf.sh & run_prob.sh) 
Create execute permission by following command :
chmod 755 run_pmf.sh
chomd 755 run_prob.sh
To compute Free Energy using Mean Force method use run_pmf.sh
./run_pmf.sh
To compute multidimensional probabilities use run_prob.sh
./run_prob.sh
```
